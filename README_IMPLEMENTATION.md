# GoHighLevel One-Time Booking Link Implementation

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Updated Form Flow**
- **Before**: Form submission ‚Üí Success page with generic message

The success page now includes:
- Clear messaging about checking email for booking link
- Explanation that the link is personalized and expires after use
- Fallback message about team follow-up if email isn't found

### 3. **Workflow-Based Approach**
Instead of trying to use non-existent API endpoints, the implementation uses GoHighLevel's native workflow system:
- Contact submission triggers workflow
- Workflow generates one-time booking link
- Workflow sends personalized email with booking link
- Link expires after booking is made

### 4. **Cleaned Up Code**
- Removed unused booking link state management
- Removed client-side booking widget embedding
- Removed unnecessary API endpoint
- Streamlined form flow to focus on lead capture
