# MASH Study Site

This project uses Next.js. A few environment variables are required to run the application.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and set the following variable:

- `SITE_URL` - The fully qualified URL of the site (e.g. `https://amarimash.netlify.app`). This value is used for the sitemap, robots.txt and structured data in `layout.js`.
